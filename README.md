# GreenScreen-Cloak
This Python program utilizes OpenCV to create an "invisibility cloak" effect by capturing a background image and replacing a specified color (blue) with it in real-time. The program first records multiple frames to generate a stable background. During execution, it applies color-based masking using HSV color space to detect the selected color, followed by morphological operations to refine the mask and remove noise. The detected color region is then replaced with the pre-captured background using bitwise operations, and Gaussian blurring is applied to smooth transitions. The result is a real-time video feed where objects of the chosen color appear invisible, seamlessly blending with the background.
